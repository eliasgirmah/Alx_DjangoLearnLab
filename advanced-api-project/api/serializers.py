    Relationship Handling:
    - The AuthorSerializer uses the related_name='books' defined in the Book model's ForeignKey.
    - This allows Django REST Framework to automatically include all related Book instances
      when serializing an Author.
    - The books field is set to read_only=True to prevent creating books directly
      through AuthorSerializer â€” books are created separately via BookSerializer.
